# Breadboard Power Supply Module

A compact breadboard power supply module designed to provide a stable and safe regulated voltage for electronics prototyping and learning.

## What is this?
This project is a small PCB that plugs directly into standard breadboard power rails and converts an external DC input into a regulated output suitable for powering simple circuits.

## Why I made it
Breadboards are commonly used for learning and prototyping, but powering them safely is often inconvenient or unreliable. I built this project to create a simple, beginner-friendly power solution while learning schematic design, component selection, and PCB layout.

## How it works
Power is supplied through a barrel jack and first passes through reverse polarity protection to prevent damage from incorrect connections. Filtering capacitors smooth the input before a linear voltage regulator provides a stable output. LEDs indicate power status, and headers connect directly to the breadboard rails.

## What I learned
Through this project I learned how physical constraints like breadboard spacing affect PCB design, why component placement matters for stability, and how datasheets guide decisions for regulators, capacitors, and protection components.
